# CinePro Backend

## Description

This repository contains the logic for the Backend of CinePro. It is an **open-source movie and tv show scraper API**. You can get various sources for the movie or tv show you are looking for using this API. It also uses node-cache to store the data it scrapes, so it does not have to scrape the same movie or tv show repeatedly.

> [!Note]
> This project is **not** meant for public hosting (you should not be able to access it over the internet). It is meant to be used as a backend for your own personal use. You can host it on your local machine or on a private server. If you want to use it as a public API, you should consider using a different project, since this project is not optimized/secured for public use.

## Features

- NO ADS and NO TRACKING!
- Supported Media types:
    - Movie
    - TV Show

> [!Warning]
> Since this project is still in development, some features might not work as expected. TV shows are not fully supported yet. It will come after the movie scraping is done.
