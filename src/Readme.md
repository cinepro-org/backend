Here you will find the following things:

- [api.js](./api.js): This file contains the API logic (getMovie(media) and getTv(media)). The Api will use all possible providers from [controllers](./controllers/) to get the data from each.
- [controllers](./controllers/): This folder contains all the controllers that will be used by the API to get the data from each provider. Each controller will have a function that will return the data from the provider.
- [utils](./utils/): This folder contains files that are being used over several providers.
